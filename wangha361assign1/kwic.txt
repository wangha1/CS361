1: I decide what to test first by design. I list all the require and follow the order to develope program by adding more function on it. I don't think the final code will change so much if I change the order of testing.
2: I don't think TDD is good in this project. Althrough TDD will have test that cover all your code, but during this process, I am kind of focuing on pass my test rether than satisfy all the requirment. On the other hand, I am not sure I cover all possible cases on my testing, I think I might prefer develop first and then do the debug. And TDD is somehow westing time, I got the idea of whole program at the first time but I have to test previous functionally first so it is kind of disturb my logic and let me focus on passing the test I set. By the way TDD can shrink the code I think, because you follow the step so you don't need to re-write the previous code when you facing a new problem.
