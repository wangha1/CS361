On my kwic from first assignment, I have 4 functions, one for main kwic, one to handle periodsToBreaks, one to handle listPairs and one to dealing shifting. Each single function can test and monitor separately. So my original version has a great testability. But when I step into real test, I found the list pair part is really slow, so you don't know if it still running when you are going to test a big file on list pairs function. So I actually add a percentage prompt on the LP function so you can monitor if it is running or crash.
